# homeworks-telecom
You will find my homework in this repository. 
As I have lots of issues to record my screen and my voice I decided to make slides for most of homeworks.
You will find links in files but I also put them here :


socket with java : https://slides.com/hugsy/deck-df83be


socket with python : https://slides.com/hugsy/deck-63a6da


grasp : https://slides.com/hugsy/minimal


spring boot heroku site : https://springboot-heroku-rtu-demo.herokuapp.com/welcome

You will also find the slide from the first classes that introduce my skills :https://slides.com/hugsy/deck
and the json homework made at the beginning of the semester : json1.py
